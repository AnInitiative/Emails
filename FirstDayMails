nice,

now can you describe more about the Application and how you want to build it?

Q's
Application technology?
expecting to use google login API? or traditional user name / password?
or both?
where will we save data -- DB choice?
how will the application keep up with multiple users registering for multiple events? how will we scan or trigger eMail for all the registered users at a registered time?
will we use google api for sending eMail? or how is it expected to get done?
can we break the whole application idea into smaller chunks, so that we can have incremental progress?

like,

User Story 1:
deploy the simple application to the cloud, and gain the ability to show a login page.

User story 2:
let the user get registered using his eMail

User Stroy 3:
Let the user login using his registered account, and get to see his home page.

User Story 4:
Display possible events on the home page, for user selection.

User Story 5:
save the user's selection, and make sure to display it back, when he logs in.

User Story 6:
Send some dummy eMail, to a registered user.

User Story 7:
send an eMail notification, for a registered event.

User Story 8:
Allow him to delete/modify any registered events; allow notifications as a configurable option.

User Story 9:
Allow the user to delete his account.

User Story 10:
Display metrics, to show no.of notifications sent to date, and related events.
